# Pong

This repository contains the source code of an implementation of the game "Pong". It was created during a course in
assembly language at the [Leipzig University of Applied Sciences](https://www.htwk-leipzig.de/startseite) in 2010.

## Caution

This program was created to be run in a save environment on an emulator. Executing it directly on an operating system
will certainly lead to a game experience, that makes it impossible to play, if it runs at all. Also, the code does not
pay any attention to hardware security issues and might bring the host system in a state, that makes it vulnerable to
crashes and hardware damage.
